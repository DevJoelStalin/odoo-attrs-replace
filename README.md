# Odoo Attrs replacer

### As Odoo changed the attrs to (no more attrs) in v17, I create this little script to help you replace all attrs in your XML files with corresponding attributes in the XML directly.

## Find a flaw ?

Please open an Issue or make a PR or contact me on LinkedIn (Pierre Locus)

WITH A TEST CASE, will be much easier for me to debug with a test case to know what's going wrong :) 

Thanks in advance!

## How to use:

Simply install with pip "beautifulsoup4" (or install -r requirements.txt)

Then launch the python script (python3 replace_attrs.py).

It will ask you the root directory to check for XML files. You can give a project's absolute path.

If nothing is given, it will use "." (current directory).

The script will ask you, for each file, if you want to replace all attrs= with related attrs in the tag (for all tags at once).

Unless you chose in the begining 'y' for auto-replace (don't ask for each file)


TODO:
  -  Support missing operators "=?", "child_of", "parent_of" (less used than the others already supported)

### Happy B-day @cma-nalios (Cl√©ment) :D
